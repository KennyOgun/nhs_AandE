## **# Project Overview: NHS A&E Waiting Times Exploratory Data Analysis**

This project aims to analyze NHS Accident & Emergency (A&E) waiting times using a comprehensive data science approach. The focus is on understanding the relationships and patterns within the data through thorough data exploration, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA). The key components of the project include:

Data/Domain Understanding and Exploration: A deep dive into the NHS A&E waiting times dataset, uncovering trends, distribution patterns, and significant insights related to patient admissions and waiting times.

Data Pre-Processing: Preparing the data by handling missing values, cleaning data inconsistencies, and transforming variables as needed to ensure optimal model performance and analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducting correlation analysis, conditioning, and comparison of summary statistics to identify key factors contributing to long waiting times (over 4 and 12 hours) and emergency admissions. The goal is to provide insights that can improve hospital efficiency and patient experience.

The projectâ€™s visualizations and statistical analyses will help showcase skills in data-driven exploration while highlighting potential solutions to real-world challenges in NHS A&E services.
